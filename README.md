# tic_tac_toe_AI

This is a little exercise where I code the game of Tic Tac Toe in R and write an AI that can play the game.

<ol>
    <li>Build the game mechanics</li>
    <li>Generate a dataset to train the AI </li>
    <li>Build a deep neural network that can evaluate a board position</li>
    <li>Implement a function that chooses the best next move </li>
</ol>
